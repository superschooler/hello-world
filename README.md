# Hello World
## My first repository on GitHub

Hello!

Thanks for viewing my first repository. Probably not super exciting as a hello-world, but it's a nice practice exercise for me to see what GitHub is all about - I've heard good things!

I found a resource for markdown syntax, [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/), and am looking forward to creating **README** files on my projects.
